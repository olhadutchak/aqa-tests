# AQA Engineer Test Assessment â€“ Playlist App

This project contains automated UI tests for the [Playlist App](https://vite-react-alpha-lemon.vercel.app/), built using **Cypress** and **JavaScript**.

## Project Overview

The goal is to test the core functionality of a simple playlist application: searching for tracks, adding them to a playlist, and verifying the total duration.

## Test Cases Implemented

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Enters a keyword in the search input field.
   - Verifies that only tracks matching the search are displayed.

2. **Add Track Using "+" Button**
   - Clicks the "+" button next to a track.
   - Verifies that the track appears in the "Your Playlist" section.

3. **Verify Total Duration of Playlist (in seconds)**
   - Adds multiple tracks to the playlist.
   - Manually calculates the total duration (from `"mm:ss"` format).
   - Verifies that it matches the UI-displayed total.
